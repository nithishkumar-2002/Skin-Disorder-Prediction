# Skin-Disorder-Prediction
Problem Statement

Task 1:-Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.
Task 2:-Create a predictive model using machine learning techniques to predict
the various classes of skin disease.
Task3:-Suggestions to the Doctors to identify the skin diseases of the patient at
the earliest.
Dataset Information:
This database contains 34 attributes, 33 of which are linear valued and one of them is
nominal.The differential diagnosis of erythemato-squamous diseases is a real problem
in dermatology. They all share the clinical features of erythema and scaling, with very
little differences. The diseases in this group are psoriasis, seboreic dermatitis, lichen
planus, pityriasis rosea, cronic dermatitis, and pityriasis rubra pilaris. Usually a biopsy is
necessary for the diagnosis but unfortunately these diseases share many
histopathological features as well. Another difficulty for the differential diagnosis is that a
disease may show the features of another disease at the beginning stage and may have
the characteristic features at the following stages. Patients were first evaluated clinically
with 12 features. Afterwards, skin samples were taken for the evaluation of 22
histopathological features. The values of the histopathological features are determined
by an analysis of the samples under a microscope.In the dataset constructed for this
domain, the family history feature has the value 1 if any of these diseases has been
observed in the family, and 0 otherwise. The age feature simply represents the age of
the patient. Every other feature (clinical and histopathological) was given a degree in
the range of 0 to 3. Here, 0 indicates that the feature was not present, 3 indicates the
largest amount possible, and 1, 2 indicate the relative intermediate values.The names
and id numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database.
